# Optimizing Logistics Efficiency in Stride Case Study

## Introduction
A Stride Case Study," aims to analyze Stride Logistics' shipment data using advanced analytics tools and techniques. The project's objectives are to provide valuable insights and data-driven decision-making support, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. By leveraging various data sources, including customer data, shipping data, and financial data, we will identify trends, patterns, and correlations to drive cost reduction, optimize logistics operations, and contribute to the long-term growth and success of Stride Logistics.

* Analyze Stride Logistics' shipment data using advanced analytics tools.
* Provide valuable insights and data-driven decision-making support.
* Improve operational efficiency and reduce costs in logistics operations.
* Enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven optimizations.

## Problem Statement
The Stride logistics industry faces challenges in optimizing operational efficiency and enhancing customer satisfaction due to limited insights derived from shipment data.
### Why?
* Limited visibility into delivery time and customer rating for performance evaluation.
* Inefficient query response management impacting customer experience.
* Difficulty in determining the impact of product importance on delivery time and customer ratings.

## Development Plan

#### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Understand data dictionaries to grasp the meaning and structure of the dataset.
- Perform data checks, such as checking for missing values, data types, and descriptive statistics of categorical and numerical columns.
- Conduct univariate analysis to explore the distribution of individual variables.
- Perform bivariate analysis to investigate relationships between different variables.
- Summarize the findings and present them in graphical representations.
  
#### Phase 2: Feature Engineering, Correlation Analysis, and Machine Learning Modeling
- Introduce new features that are relevant to the problem and dataset.
- Evaluate the correlation between the target variable and the newly introduced features to select the most impactful ones.
- Explore and select multiple machine learning models and identify the best fit model based on evaluation metrics.
- Analyze the relationships between these factors and timely deliveries to provide further recommendations. For instance, you may identify certain weight ranges that are more prone to delays and suggest possible improvements in packaging or shipping methods.
  
#### Phase 3: Application Development
- Develop a Python Flask web application to enable user interaction.
- Users can upload an Excel sheet containing their data to the app.
- The application will perform analytical and machine learning operations on the uploaded sheet.
- Provide insights through exploratory data analysis, machine learning model results, accuracy measures, and business recommendations for current and future scenarios.
